Hello!

🌟 Successfully Completed the <b>"50 Derste MVC"</b> Course! 🌟

👨‍🏫 Under the guidance of our incredible instructor, Murat Yücedağ, I’ve proudly completed the "50 Derste MVC" course on YouTube!

💡 Here’s what I’ve accomplished:

✅ <b>CRUD Operations:</b> Implemented for Customers, Products, Categories, and Sales with smooth functionality.

🔍 <b>Validation:</b> Ensured accurate data entry with validation rules like MaxLength and Required.

📄 <b>Pagination:</b> Incorporated paging on the Categories and Products pages for a seamless browsing experience.

⚠️ <b>Alerts & Popups:</b> Added alerts for customer deletion and a stylish popup modal for sales data entry.

🔎 <b>Search Functionality:</b>

A search panel was added to the Customers page for quick filtering.

Leveraged the Datatable jQuery plugin on the Products page for enhanced paging & search features.

🛠️ <b>Technology Stack:</b>

<b>ASP.NET MVC5</b> powers the application.

<b>Entity Framework</b> (Database First approach) ensures a robust ORM layer.

<b>MSSQL Server</b> serves as the reliable database backbone.

🎉 I extend my heartfelt thanks to Murat Yücedağ and Erhan Gündüz for their invaluable support throughout this journey. 🙏

🚀 Excited for the next adventure in software development!
