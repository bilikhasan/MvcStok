Hello!

🌟 Successfully Completed the "50 Derste MVC" Course! 🌟

👨‍🏫 Under the guidance of our incredible instructor, Murat Yücedağ, I’ve proudly completed the "50 Derste MVC" course on YouTube!

💡 Here’s what I’ve accomplished:

✅ CRUD Operations: Implemented for Customers, Products, Categories, and Sales with smooth functionality.

🔍 Validation: Ensured accurate data entry with validation rules like MaxLength and Required.

📄 Pagination: Incorporated paging on the Categories and Products pages for a seamless browsing experience.

⚠️ Alerts & Popups: Added alerts for customer deletion and a stylish popup modal for sales data entry.

🔎 Search Functionality:

A search panel was added to the Customers page for quick filtering.

Leveraged the Datatable jQuery plugin on the Products page for enhanced paging & search features.

🛠️ Technology Stack:

ASP.NET MVC5 powers the application.

Entity Framework (Database First approach) ensures a robust ORM layer.

MSSQL Server serves as the reliable database backbone.

🎉 I extend my heartfelt thanks to Murat Yücedağ and Erhan Gündüz for their invaluable support throughout this journey. 🙏

🚀 Excited for the next adventure in software development!
